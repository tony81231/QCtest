## 📌 **Detailed Observations**

### ✅ Positives:

* **Exposure** is excellent—image is bright but not overexposed.
* **Window view** is retained nicely without being too distracting.
* **White cabinetry** retains subtle shadow details—avoids "blown-out white" look.
* **Wood floor and faucet details** are sharp and vibrant.

### ⚠️ Minor Issues:

* **Slight clipping** (around pendant lights and window top areas) due to intense highlights—common in HDR edits but worth noting.
* The **light reflection** in the pendant glass may look a bit artificial in close inspection (minor and often acceptable).
